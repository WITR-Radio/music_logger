### HELPER ###
def db_overwatch():

        note: this might not be a good idea if the application ever has to scale since constantly checking for updates to rows
        is taxing on databases, especially mysql. If performance is bad you will have to have this server listen to rvdl's
        command output over udp instead of querying the database directly for changes. This will increase performance in all
        except a few edge cases. However whatever you do, DO NOT OPEN UP A TRANSACTION FOR EVERY REQUEST. This leads to
        a security and memory leak issue this application was designed to fix compared to the php version.

        query: SELECT * FROM Tracks JOIN Groups ON Tracks.group_id=Groups.id WHERE Tracks.created_at >= time;
